# animated weather icons for the unicorn-hat-hd by LovebootCaptain
# ****************************************************************
#
# The icons in the /icons folder are made of 32-36 individual 16x16 images combined to a sprite.
#
# draw_animation(image) is same as in the 'show-png' example but put into a tiny little function.
# Put in your image object and you're done. The function will loop through all images in the sprite
# and it will look like a tiny animation. Awesome !!
#
# You can change the 'fps' with changing the 'cycle_time' variable (0.25 is very smooth)
#
# loop() finally loops through all png images in a folder (you might guessed it) so you can see all possibilities.
#
# usage:
#
# 'weather-icons.py loop' for all animations or images
#
# 'weather-icons.py clear-day.png' for a single animation or image
